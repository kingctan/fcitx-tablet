fcitx-tablet
============

The aim of this project is to enable the entry of characters via a graphics tablet, integrated into the [fcitx](https://github.com/fcitx/fcitx/) input method framework. Your strokes are drawn on screen as you write.

fcitx-tablet is easily extensible for different tablet drivers. Currently it only supports a cheap tablet I bought at 中关村, see the [wiki page on hardware support](wiki/Hardware-Support) for details.

fcitx-tablet is easily extensible for different handwriting recognition engines. Currently it supports [zinnia](http://zinnia.sourceforge.net/) (however results are fairly poor) and forking to an external (potentially proprietary) recognition engine.
